    do the following:
    1. load the dataset
    2. construct the model
        - n_lstm layers with the correct configs
        - n_dense layers
        - (i need dropout layer between every lstm)
        - (i need last lstm to return sequences)
    3. compile the model
        - loss function
        - optimizer
        - metrics
    4. train the model
    5. test the model
    6. show graph of history
    7. save the model
